# HexCodeClock

HexCodeClock is a macOS Screensaver that displays the current time as a hex color code, with the background color changing based on the time.

The idea is, that time would be formatted as HHmmss, but in 24-hour format. If we take that, turn it into a string, and run it though NSColor as hex, we get our HexCodeClock!

For example:

- It is currently 3:17:23pm. 
- We take that in 24-hour time, as 15:17:23
- Remove the colons: 151723
- Add a pound sign so the time becomes a hexcolor: [#151723](http://www.colorhexa.com/151723)
